# EDA
Exploratory data analysis of medical images using Python functions. 

Types of data analysis includes opening and reading DICOM format files, forming a histogram with the pixel values of the medical images, visualization of 2D and 3D images (including an interactive 3D visualization), performing simple segmentations of target tissues/organs, and applying various types of filters on the medical images.
