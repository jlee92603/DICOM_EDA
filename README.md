# EDA
Exploratory data analysis of medical images using Python functions. 

Types of data analysis includes opening and reading DICOM format files, forming a histogram with the pixel values of the medical images, visualization of 2D and 3D images (including an interactive 3D visualization), performing simple segmentations of target tissues/organs, and applying various types of filters on the medical images.

## Segmentation of Lung Images
* [LUNG SEGMENTATIONS](https://github.com/jlee92603/DICOM_EDA/blob/main/Segmentation%20of%20lungs.ipynb)

Lung and vessel segmentations done on NIFTI format medical images by creating contours.

## DICOM Image Analysis
* [LUNG/CHEST IMAGES](https://github.com/jlee92603/DICOM_EDA/blob/main/chest_lung_images.ipynb)
* [PELVIS IMAGES](https://github.com/jlee92603/DICOM_EDA/blob/main/pelvis_images.ipynb)
* [ANKLE IMAGES](https://github.com/jlee92603/DICOM_EDA/blob/main/ankle_images.ipynb)

In addition to the functions in the examples above, there is an additional function that allows 3D interactive visual model of the images. The resulting interactive model's file size was too big to include; hence, a screen recording of the interactive model is attached below.
